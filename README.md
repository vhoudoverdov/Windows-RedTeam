# Windows-RedTeam

This repository contains custom resources I have developed for Red Team exercises or Pentesting engagements in Windows environments.

### ClobberTime

Graphical frontend that provides functionality for manipulation of MAC (Modified, Accessed, Created) timestamps during Windows Red Team or Pentesting engagements, without modifying current system time or any file hashes. Extends the functionality of the Timestomp module located in https://github.com/vhoudoverdov/Security-Utils/

This utility can be wrapped in a binary (exe) and signed with a forged software-signing certificate for additional evasion.
